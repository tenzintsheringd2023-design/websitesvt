        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>I study in The Royal Academy. I joined in the year at the 2023, which makes me and my grademates the eighth batch in the school.</p>

        <h2>Grade 7</h2>
        <p>Grade seven was the start of my  journey. it was really new to me since I had to learn lots of new things. First was learning about 
            the five areas of development.
            <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68b41787b0ee6a1df9470c7d/ab6293b4-1f20-4e7a-a6f0-802b7904aebc/Screenshot+2025-09-05+at+12.39.02%E2%80%AFPM.png?format=750w" alt=""style="width: 900px; height: 400px; border-radius: 12px;">
        </p>
        <p>After that was learning and adapting to the kind of environment I was in. First it was really difficlut
            but with the help of my mentor, friends and teachers I adapted really quick to the environment I was 
            in. In grade seven, it was all learning about the environmrnt I was in.
        </p>
        <h2>Grade 8 </h2>
        <p>Grade 8 was really difficult for me. It was my first year approaching a national exam without any 
            guidebooks or textbooks, but I pulled off and got the marks I was aiming for especially in technology
            since we had to learn all the conepts in two months before our review began.

        </p>
        <h2>Grade 9</h2>
        <p>This year was the year of exploring where i participated in lots of things. These experience and activities
            helped me to learn lots of things. Moreover this year was the year where I enjoyed the most.

        <h2>My Skills/Strength</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Origami</li>
            <li>Socializing</li>
            <li>Emotional Support</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>1. Origami</h2>
        <p>One skills or strength i am proud of myself, is my interest in learning origami. The first environment
            thing I learnt to make was a crane from my friend. Before, I didn't even know how to make a simple 
            aeroplane. But after I learnt how to make a crane form my friend I realized how fun and interesting it was.
            Moreover it also taught me how to be patient as I realized one single mistake in folding could ruin the 
            whole output I wanted. Now I have learnt lots of things such as making flowers(which is really important
            if you want to gift someone a bouquet), butterlies, dragons, frogs, cats etc..and cranes(obviously). I mostly learn
            it from online tutorials.

        <h2>2.Socializing</h2>
        <p>After coming to The Royal Academy, one of my greates strength was the social area of development
            I was open to everyone and others also approached me. Moreover I always treated the juniors really
            well and interacted with them making them comfortable around me so they don't homesick or sad after
            coming to a new environment without their parents or guardian.

        <p>Hi! My name is Tenzin Tshering Drukar. I am from Trashi Yangtse, the eastern part of Bhutan.</p>
        <p>I am currently studying in The Royal Academy.</p>

        <img src="https://www.bbs.bt/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/dunkar.jpg" alt="Image">

        <p>I used to study in Kheni Lower Secondary School, one of the most remote schools in Trashi Yangtse. Although it was very remote, I got my very first education from there, so I am truly grateful. Because of that school, I got the opportunity to study where I am today.</p>
