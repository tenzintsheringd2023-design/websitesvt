        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! My name is Tenzin Tshering Drukar. I am from Trashi Yangtse, the eastern part of Bhutan.</p>
        <p>I am currently studying in The Royal Academy.</p>
        <img src="https://www.bbs.bt/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/dunkar.jpg" alt="Image">
        <p>I used to study in Kheni Lower Secondary School, one of the most remote schools in Trashi Yangtse. Although it was very remote, I got my very first education from there, so I am truly grateful. Because of that school, I got the opportunity to study where I am today.</p>

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>I study in The Royal Academy. I joined in the year 2023, which makes me and my grademates the eighth batch in the school.</p>

        <h2>Grade 7</h2>
        <p>Grade seven was the start of my journey. It was really new to me since I had to learn lots of new things. First was learning about the five areas of development.</p>
        <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68b41787b0ee6a1df9470c7d/ab6293b4-1f20-4e7a-a6f0-802b7904aebc/Screenshot+2025-09-05+at+12.39.02%E2%80%AFPM.png?format=750w" alt="" style="width: 900px; height: 400px; border-radius: 12px;">
        <p>After that was learning and adapting to the kind of environment I was in. First it was really difficult, but with the help of my mentor, friends, and teachers I adapted really quickly to the environment I was in. In grade seven, it was all learning about the environment I was in.</p>

        <h2>Grade 8</h2>
        <p>Grade 8 was really difficult for me. It was my first year approaching a national exam without any guidebooks or textbooks, but I pulled off and got the marks I was aiming for, especially in technology, since we had to learn all the concepts in two months before our review began.</p>

        <h2>Grade 9</h2>
        <p>This year was the year of exploring where I participated in lots of things. These experiences and activities helped me to learn lots of things. Moreover, this year was the year where I enjoyed the most.</p>

        <h2>My Skills/Strength</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Origami</li>
            <li>Socializing</li>
            <li>Emotional Support</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1. Origami</h2>
        <p>One skill or strength I am proud of is my interest in learning origami. The first thing I learnt to make was a crane from my friend. Before, I didn't even know how to make a simple aeroplane. But after I learnt how to make a crane from my friend, I realized how fun and interesting it was. Moreover, it also taught me how to be patient, as I realized one single mistake in folding could ruin the whole output I wanted. Now I have learnt lots of things such as making flowers (important if you want to gift someone a bouquet), butterflies, dragons, frogs, cats, etc., and cranes (obviously). I mostly learn it from online tutorials.</p>
        <div style="display: flex; gap: 15px; margin-top: 20px;">
            <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQobOBjmlGPk8fnLNbJgg9sk3yy1RhQZEeKVg&s" alt="" style="width: 400px; border-radius: 10px;">
            <img src="https://origamiblooms.com/cdn/shop/files/Wedding-anniversary-bouquet-orange-pink.jpg?v=1712924245&width=1500" alt="" style="width: 400px; border-radius: 10px;">
        </div>
        <p>Origami is the traditional Japanese art of folding paper into shapes such as animals, flowers, and objects. It is more than just a creative hobby—it helps develop focus, patience, and problem-solving skills. It also improves hand–eye coordination and fine motor skills. In schools, origami is used to teach mathematics, including geometry, symmetry, and fractions. Beyond creativity, it reduces stress, encourages relaxation, and allows people to express themselves through art. Origami is important because it connects culture, creativity, and learning in a simple yet meaningful way.</p>

        <h2>2. Socializing</h2>
        <p>After coming to The Royal Academy, one of my greatest strengths was the social area of development. I was open to everyone, and others also approached me. Moreover, I always treated the juniors really well and interacted with them, making them comfortable around me so they don't feel homesick or sad after coming to a new environment without their parents or guardian.</p>
        <div style="display: flex; gap: 15px; margin-top: 20px;">
            <img src="https://img-cdn.heictojpg.com/jpg/ab802e1359dfd744/899056bf-efa0-4233-b5e7-1c95d6795ab1.thumbnail.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px; border-radius: 10px;">

        </div>

        <h2>3. Emotional Support</h2>
        <p>One of my strengths is my ability to give emotional support to the people around me. I make sure others are heard, valued, and understood, especially during difficult or stressful moments. I create a safe space where people can talk about their thoughts without feeling judged. By listening with care and offering encouragement, I help others feel less alone and more confident in themselves. Emotional support is not just about comforting someone; it is about showing them that they do not have to face their challenges by themselves, and that genuine kindness and connection can make a real difference.</p>
